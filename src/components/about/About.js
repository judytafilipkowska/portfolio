                <p> I'm a full-stack developer, keen on back-end technologies and working on a better UI. Besides that, I practice modern style dancing and learn to play the ukulele. </p> 
                <p>Iâ€™m a big fan of Thai and Vietnamese food. I love hiking and kayaking, and I admit that kayaking awakens my inner athlete, who usually breaths heavily when walking.</p>
                <p> My plans programming-wise are to master technologies I work with and improve those by learning Redux and SQL databases, and then I plan to learn Python.</p>

                        <li>   I have a tough time telling apart left and right.</li>
                        <li>My record of steps taken throughout one day is 41 402</li>
                        <li> Once I had been eating lasagna for three weeks straight, every day.</li>
